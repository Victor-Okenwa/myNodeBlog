Node.js Blog with Express, Multer, and EJS
This is a simple blog built with Node.js using the Express framework, Multer for handling file uploads, and EJS as the templating engine.

Features
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files. In this blog, Multer is employed to handle image uploads for blog posts.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A simple templating engine that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It allows dynamic content rendering on the server side.
